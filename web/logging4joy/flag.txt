I found something interesting

        function getRandomResponse() {
            var responses = [
                "That's interesting, tell me more.",
                "I'm not sure I understand.",
                "Can you rephrase that?",
                "You are not getting the answer that way.",
                "Try again when I am feeling better please.",
                "You look very nice today, I hope you know :)",
                "Nope.",

                /*
                
                //if you are looking for the flag, maybe type something with this {jndi:ldap://}

                */
                "Lol, not today.",
                "Please stop spamming me.",
                "Oh, that's interesting! Tell me more.",
                "Hmm, I'm not quite sure what you mean.",
                "Could you elaborate on that?",
                "That sounds exciting!",
                "I see, but could you clarify a bit?",
                "Wow, I had no idea!",
                "Are you sure about that?",
                "That's a great point.",
                "I understand. What next?",
                "Can you rephrase that for me?",
                "Let's change the topic, shall we?",
                "I'm here to listen... go on.",
                "That's quite a thought.",
                "Do you really think so?",
                "I'm not sure I agree.",
                "That's one way to look at it.",
                "Interesting perspective. Anything else?",
                "That's a bit beyond my understanding.",
                "Hmm, let's ponder on that.",
                "I'm all ears.",
                "Can we delve deeper into this topic?",
                "I'm intrigued, please continue.",
                "That's something new to me.",
                "Quite a unique viewpoint!",
                "Let's unpack that statement a bit more.",
                ];
            return responses[Math.floor(Math.random() * responses.length)];
        }



send this to the bot. {jndi:ldap://}

you get the flag: 
Whoops the flag leaked: jctf{logged_into_the_matrix}
